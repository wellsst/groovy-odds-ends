# groovy-odds-ends
A collection of some things done in the Groovy lang, int some cases a large script/app that might be useful in itself 
or for seeing how to code something, but many are small and undocumented...just enough to figure something out at the time 

A few scripts that may need some polishing up but are IMHO ok examples of the power of [Groovy](http://www.groovy-lang.org/)
